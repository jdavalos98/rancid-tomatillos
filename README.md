# Rancid Tomatillos 

# üìΩÔ∏è Overview of Project and Goals

Rancid Tomatillos is a movie exploration app where users can browse, view details, and interact with movie listings. The project started with mock data and evolved to integrate a backend API, with a focus on a seamless user experience and structured testing.

The main goals of this project include:
	‚Ä¢	Fetching and displaying movie data dynamically
	‚Ä¢	Implementing React Router for smooth navigation
	‚Ä¢	Writing Cypress tests to ensure reliability
	‚Ä¢	Enhancing the UI with vote counts and styling

# Set Up
1.  Fork this repo
2.  Clone **and rename** this repo: `git clone [remote-address] [new-name]`  
   For example: `git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/rancid-tomatillos-starter.git rancid-tomatillos`
4.  `cd` into the directory
5.  Install necessary dependencies with `npm install`
6.  Run your React app with `npm start`
7.  Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see a page with some starter elements
8.  Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop running the React app at any time
9. To run Cypress tests, use `npx cypress open`

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used, Challenges, Wins & Reflections

## Technologies Used:

	‚Ä¢	Frontend: React 
	‚Ä¢	Testing: Cypress 
	‚Ä¢	Backend API: The Movie DB API 
	‚Ä¢	State Management: Local state with hooks
	‚Ä¢	Deployment: Render

## Challenges Faced
	‚Ä¢	Transitioning from mock data to API requests
	‚Ä¢	Whether to keep React Router in App.js or integrate it with data management
	‚Ä¢	Weather we should create a new state in movieDetails.js


## Wins & Reflections:

‚úÖ Successfully integrated the backend API while keeping components lightweight

‚úÖ Successfully Deployed our project
